-- Royalty free music tracks for independent productions by composer Gianmarco Leone

This set of royalty free musics is a "comprehensive musical toolkit" with a wide palette of sounds.

From creepy to rythmed, from sad to happy, from solemn to childish, you will have at your disposal a good number of musics for your games.

The set includes a total of 17 tracks of varying length.

Funk Chase, Industrial, Kung_Fu_Gang and Persian are loopable.

If you use the track in your project, I appreciate if you let me know at info@gianmarcoleone.com
